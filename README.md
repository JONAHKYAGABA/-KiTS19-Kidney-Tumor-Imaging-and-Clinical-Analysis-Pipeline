# -KiTS19-Kidney-Tumor-Imaging-and-Clinical-Analysis-Pipeline
ðŸ§  KiTS19 Kidney Tumor Imaging and Clinical Analysis Pipeline
This project implements a full end-to-end pipeline for the KiTS19 dataset. It supports preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning modeling, and survival analysis of kidney tumor cases derived from CT scans and metadata.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
âœ… Automated preprocessing: resampling, metadata cleaning
âœ… Visualizations: slices with overlays, metadata-augmented images
âœ… Tumor volume, kidney-to-tumor ratio, heterogeneity analysis
âœ… Demographic and tumor characteristic analysis
âœ… Survival modeling (Kaplan-Meier, Cox)
âœ… ML models for predicting malignancy & complications
âœ… Export of analysis figures, reports, and case summaries
ðŸ›  Pipeline Overview
1. Data Preprocessing
Resample all CT scans and segmentations to isotropic spacing (1.5Ã—1.5Ã—1.5 mmÂ³)

Flatten and clean metadata from kits.json

Normalize numeric fields, encode categorical fields

2. Visualization
Generate middle slice overlays (volume + segmentation)

Annotate slices with metadata

Save slice-wise PNGs for all cases

3. Analysis Modules
Demographics
Age & gender distributions

BMI analysis by malignancy

Comorbidity prevalence

Tumor Characteristics
Histologic subtype frequencies

Radiographic vs pathologic size comparisons

TNM staging and ISUP grade analysis

Imaging Features
Tumor & kidney volumes (cmÂ³)

Volume ratios

Tumor heterogeneity metrics (entropy, range, std)

Survival Outcomes
Kaplan-Meier plots

Cox Proportional Hazards modeling

eGFR tracking across timepoints

Predictive Models
Random Forest & Logistic Regression

Predicting:

Tumor malignancy

Post-operative complications
